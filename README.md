# WaySure🌐

     **🚦 Smart Public Transport Route Safety System 🚦**

     🌍 Because the fastest route isn’t always the safest.

**💡 About The Project:**

        Urban navigation apps usually prioritize speed ⏱️ — but safety matters just as much, especially for women and vulnerable commuters.
        WaySure is a smart web-based platform that helps users compare multiple travel routes based on:
            🛣️ Distance
            ⏱️ Travel Time
            🛡️ Safety Score
            👥 Crowd Density Level
       It empowers users to make informed and confident commuting decisions.

**🚀 Key Features:**

    **->**✨ Multi-Route Comparison:
               Compare different routes between two locations instantly.
    **->**🛡️ Safety Score Calculation:
               Generated using contextual factors like:
                  🌙 Time of day
                  💡 Lighting conditions
                  🛣️ Road type (main road / isolated road / market area)
                  ⭐ Simulated user feedback
    **->**👥 Crowd Level Indicator:
               Displays estimated crowd density for safer decision-making.
    **->**🗺️ Embedded Google Maps Integration:
               Selected route is visualized for real-time navigation and traffic view.

**🧠 How It Works:**

    **1.**User enters source & destination 📍
    **2.**System fetches available routes
    **3.**Safety & crowd intelligence layer evaluates each route
    **4.**Routes displayed as interactive cards 🗂️
    **5.**User selects preferred route → Visualized on map 🗺️
    

**🏗️ Tech Stack:**

    ~🌐 Frontend: HTML / CSS / JavaScript
    ~⚙️ Backend: Flask / Python
    ~🗺️ Maps: Google Maps Embedded API
    ~🧮 Safety Engine: Rule-Based Scoring System

**🎯 Problem Statement:**

    Current navigation systems optimize for speed, not safety. WaySure introduces a Safety Intelligence Layer on top of existing map services to make commuting smarter and safer.

**🌟 Vision:**

     To create inclusive, scalable, and safety-aware navigation systems that enhance public transport experiences for everyone.
